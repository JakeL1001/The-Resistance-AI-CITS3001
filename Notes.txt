Suspicious Actions:
Being on a mission which failed, chance of being a spy (if 3 on mission and 1 fail card, 33% chance of being spy)
Proposing a mission that fails, chance of being a spy (if proposer knew there were spies on the mission, they could be a spy, could also be an accident)
Voting yes for a mission which failed, chance of being a spy (if voter knew that there are spies on the mission, they could be a spy)
Voting no for a mission which succeeds, chance of being a spy (if voter knew that there are no spies on the misison, they could be a spy 
                                                                                                                    (as the mission would be a success for the resistance))
Voting no when on a mission with certain people (spies want to avoid sending multiple on the same mission to avoid 2 fail votes)
Another player voting differently to yourself (assuming our agent is making an informed decision based on what we already know)


Non-Suspicious Actions:
Being on a misison that succeeds, less chance of being a spy (Lower chance of being spy if mission passes, as a spy would be unlikely to let the resistence get a point)
Proposing a misison that succeeds, less chance of being a spy (Either they suspected no mission members to be spies, or maybe the spies decided not to sabotage)
Voting no for a mission which fails, less chance of being a spy (Likely suspected that there are spies on the mission, voting no indicates resistence)
Voting yes for a mission that succeeds, less chance of being a spy (Likely suspected that there are no spies on the mission, indicates resistence)

Proposing Missions:
As resistance member:
If first round: choose yourself, and the people next in line to be leader (if all are not spy, then next few people should propose the same 3 - (might not work well if some of the other agents playing are making random moves early)). If they don't, or some agents vote no to proposition, they could be a spy
Other rounds: choose least suspicious people based on combination value

As spy:
Always include 1 spy, try to choose spies that haven't done anything suspicious
Choose spies that have been on missions already but haven't failed them

depending on number of players results in the number of spies in a game
spy_count = {5:2, 6:2, 7:3, 8:3, 9:3, 10:4}

each game should have a set of spy combinations with a probability value, all values should be equal at the start of a game
a spy combination should be a set of names of agents equal to the number of spies present in a given game size
in a game of 7 players, there should be a set of spy combinations in which every combination of 3 agents occurs
eg agents1-agents7

set of all spy combinations in a game with 7 players and 3 spies, each agent labelled 1-7
35 different combinations of agents
if player 1 is you and you are not a spy, 15/35 combinations are impossible, each other combination has a 1/20 chance of being true, or 5%
1,2,3   2,3,4   3,4,5   4,5,6   5,6,7
1,2,4   2,3,5   3,4,6   4,5,7
1,2,5   2,3,6   3,4,7   4,6,7
1,2,6   2,3,7   3,5,6
1,2,7   2,4,5   3,5,7
1,3,4   2,4,6   3,6,7
1,3,5   2,4,7 
1,3,6   2,5,6
1,3,7   2,5,7
1,4,5   2,6,7
1,4,6
1,4,7
1,5,6
1,5,7
1,6,7

5 players = 2 spies = 10 combinations
if 0 is you and you are not a spy, 4/10 combinations are impossible, each other combination has a 1/6 chance of being true, or 16.67%
0,1     1,2     2,3     3,4
0,2     1,3     2,4
0,3     1,4
0,4

6 players = 2 spies = 15 combinations
7 players = 3 spies = 35 combinations
8 players = 3 spies = 56 combinations
9 players = 3 spies = 84 combinations
10 players = 4 spies = 210 combinations

each combination has an equal chance of being true at the start of the game, The probability of a combination being true changes as the game progresses.
if an agent does something suspicious, the probability of all combinations involving that spy increases.
if an agent does something non-suspicious, the probability of all combinations involving that spy decreases.

If resistence, reduce the number of suspicious agents on a mission, do not propose them on a mission together, and do not vote for them on a mission, 
    eg if set 2,5,7 is suspected to be spies, do not vote for missions containing these members

Majority of votes yes needed to approve mission, draw of votes or majority no does not approve the mission

self.worlds contains all worlds that could be true, and the probability of each world being true
having 0s would skew data,

self.validprobabilities, contain all worlds

each player can have a percentage chance that they are a spy based on average of scores of worlds they are in
